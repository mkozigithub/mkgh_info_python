Once you pick a framework that allows modelling of your situation, you then see which elements are \"fixed\" and which are flexible.

(To be clear, it doesn\\'t claim \"Less than 5 TB isn\\'t big data\", but just \"Less than 5 TB isn\\'t big enough that you need Hadoop\".)</p>\\n\\n<p>But even on smaller datasets, big data technologies like Hadoop can have other advantages, including being well suited to batch operations, playing well with unstructured data (as well as data whose structure isn\\'t known in advance or could change), horizontal scalability (scaling by adding more nodes instead of beefing up your existing servers), and (as one of the commenters on the above-linked post notes) the ability to integrate your data processing with external data sets (think of a map-reduce where the mapper makes a call to another server).  Other technologies associated with big data, like NoSql databases, emphasize fast performance and consistent availability while dealing with large sets of data, as well also being able to handle semi-unstructured data and to scale horizontally.</p>\\n\\n<p>Of course, traditional RDBMS have their own advantages including ACID guarantees (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) and better performance for certain operations, as well as being more standardized, more mature, and (for many users) more familiar.  So even for indisputably \"big\" data, it may make sense to load at least a portion of your data into a traditional SQL database and use that in conjunction with big data technologies.</p>\\n\\n<p>So, a more generous definition would be that you have big data so long as it\\'s big enough that big data technologies provide some added value for you.  But as you can see, that can depend not just on the size of your data but on how you want to work with it and what sort of requirements you have in terms of flexibility, consistency, and performance.  <em>How</em> you\\'re using your data is more relevant to the question than what you\\'re using it <em>for</em> (e.g. data mining).  That said, uses like data mining and machine learning are more likely to yield useful results if you have a big enough data set to work with.</p>\\n',\n",

Note that the solutions you get are sensitive to initial conditions, as discussed <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/ftp/cs/papers/0603/0603120.pdf\">here</a> (PDF), for instance.</p>\\n\\n<p>Huang\\'s paper (linked above) also has a section on \"k-prototypes\" which applies to data with a mix of categorical and numeric features.  It uses a distance measure which mixes the Hamming distance for categorical features and the Euclidean distance for numeric features.</p>\\n\\n<p>A Google search for \"k-means mix of categorical data\" turns up quite a few more recent papers on various algorithms for k-means-like clustering with a mix of categorical and numeric data.

(See Ralambondrainy, H. 1995. A conceptual version of the k-means algorithm. Pattern Recognition Letters, 16:1147–1157.)

There are some important differences, but much code written for S runs unaltered under R.</p>\\n\\n<p>R provides a wide variety of statistical (linear and nonlinear modelling, classical statistical tests, time-series analysis, classification, clustering, ...) and graphical techniques, and is highly extensible. The S language is often the vehicle of choice for research in statistical methodology, and R provides an Open Source route to participation in that activity.</p>\\n\\n<p>One of R\\'s strengths is the ease with which well-designed publication-quality plots can be produced, including mathematical symbols and formulae where needed. Great care has been taken over the defaults for the minor design choices in graphics, but the user retains full control.</p>\\n\\n<p>R was created by <a href=\"http://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~ihaka/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ross Ihaka</a> and <a href=\"http://www.gene.com/scientists/our-scientists/robert-gentleman\" rel=\"nofollow\">Robert Gentleman</a> and is now developed by the <a href=\"http://www.r-project.org/contributors.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">R Development Core Team</a>. The R environment is easily extended through a packaging system on <a href=\"http://cran.r-project.org\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"CRAN The Comprehensive R Archive Network\">CRAN</a>. </p>\\n\\n<p>R is available as Free Software under the terms of the Free Software Foundation\\'s GNU General Public License in source code form. It compiles and runs on a wide variety of UNIX platforms and similar systems (including FreeBSD and Linux), Windows and Mac OS.</p>\\n',\n",

       "  '<p>From my point of view, this question is suitable for a two-step answer. The first part, let us call it <em>soft preprocessing</em>, could be taken as the usage of different data mining algorithms to preprocess data in such a way that makes it suitable for further analyses. Notice that this could be the analysis itself, in case the goal is simple enough to be tackled in a single shot.</p>\\n\\n<p>The second part, the <em>hard preprocessing</em>, actually comes prior to any other process, and is may be taken as the usage of simple tools or scripts to clean up data, selecting specific contents to be processed. To this problem, POSIX provides us with a wonderous set of magic tools, which can be used to compose concise -- and very powerful -- preprocessing scripts.</p>\\n\\n<p>For example, for people who deal with data coming from social websites (twitter, facebook, ...), the <em>data retrieval</em> usually yields files with very specific format -- although not always nicely structure, as they may contain missing fields, and so. For these cases, a simple <code>awk</code> script could clean up the data, producing a <em>valid</em> input file for later processing. From the magic set, one may also point out <code>grep</code>, <code>sed</code>, <code>cut</code>, <code>join</code>, <code>paste</code>, <code>sort</code>, and a whole multitude of other tools.</p>\\n\\n<p>In case simple the source file has too many nitty-gritties, it may also be necessary to produce a bundle of methods to clean up data. In such cases, it is usually better to use scripting languages (other than shell ones), such as Python, Ruby, and Perl. This allows for building up <em>API</em>\\'s to select specific data in a very straightforward and reusable way. Such <em>API</em>\\'s are sometimes made public by their writers, such as <a href=\"http://imdbpy.sourceforge.net/\">IMDbPY</a>, <a href=\"https://api.stackexchange.com/docs\">Stack Exchange API</a>, and many others.</p>\\n\\n<p>So, answering the question: are there any best practices? It usually depends on your task. If you will always deal with the same data format, it\\'s commonly best to write an <em>organized</em> script to preprocess it; whereas, if you just need a simple and fast clean up on some dataset, count on POSIX tools for concise shell scripts that will do the whole job <strong>much</strong> faster than a Python script, or so. Since the <em>clean up</em> depends both on the dataset and on your purposes, it\\'s hard to have everything already done. Yet, there are lots of API\\'s that puts you halfway through with the problem.</p>\\n',\n",

To make it more straightforward, consider the following example: you\\'re hired by some scientists to provide them with a model to predict the growth of some kind of plants. The scientists have given you information collected from their work \\nwith such plants throughout a whole year, and they shall continuously give you information on the future development of their plantation.</p>\\n\\n<p>So, you run through the data received, and build up a model out of it. Now suppose that, in your model, you considered just as many characteristics as possible to always find out the exact behavior of the plants you saw in the initial dataset. Now, as the production continues, you\\'ll always take into account those characteristics, and will produce very <em>fine-grained</em> results. However, if the plantation eventually suffer from some seasonal change, the results you will receive may fit your model in such a way that your predictions will begin to fail (either saying that the growth will slow down, while it shall actually speed up, or the opposite).</p>\\n\\n<p>Apart from being unable to detect such small variations, and to usually classify your entries incorrectly, the <em>fine-grain</em> on the model, i.e., the great amount of variables, may cause the processing to be too costly. Now, imagine that your data is already complex.

Querying, or\\n  traversing, the graph involves following paths. Because of the\\n  fundamentally path-oriented nature of the datamodel, the majority of\\n  path-based graph database operations are highly aligned with the way\\n  in which the data is laid out, making them extremely efficient. In\\n  their book Neo4j in Action, Partner and Vukotic perform an experiment\\n  using a relational store and Neo4j.</p>\\n  \\n  <p>The comparison shows that the graph database is substantially quicker\\n  for connected data than a relational store.Partner and Vukotic’s\\n  experiment seeks to find friends-of-friends in a social network, to a\\n  maximum depth of five. Given any two persons chosen at random, is\\n  there a path that connects them which is at most five relationships\\n  long? For a social network containing 1,000,000 people, each with\\n  approximately 50 friends, the results strongly suggest that graph\\n  databases are the best choice for connected data, as we see in Table\\n  2-1.</p>\\n  \\n  <p>Table 2-1. Finding extended friends in a relational database versus efficient finding in Neo4j</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>Depth   RDBMS Execution time (s)    Neo4j Execution time (s)     Records returned\\n2       0.016                       0.01                         ~2500    \\n3       30.267                      0.168                        ~110,000 \\n4       1543.505                    1.359                        ~600,000 \\n5       Unfinished                  2.132                        ~800,000\\n</code></pre>\\n  \\n  <p>At depth two (friends-of-friends) both the relational database and the graph database perform well enough for us to consider using them in an online system. While the Neo4j query runs in two-thirds the time of the relational one, an end-user would barely notice the the difference in milliseconds between the two. By the time we reach depth three (friend-of-friend-of-friend), however, it’s clear that the relational database can no longer deal with the query in a reasonable timeframe: the thirty seconds it takes to complete would be completely unacceptable for an online system. In contrast, Neo4j’s response time remains relatively flat: just a fraction of a second to perform the query—definitely quick enough for an online system.</p>\\n  \\n  <p>At depth four the relational database exhibits crippling latency,\\n  making it practically useless for an online system. Neo4j’s timings\\n  have deteriorated a little too, but the latency here is at the\\n  periphery of being acceptable for a responsive online system. Finally,\\n  at depth five, the relational database simply takes too long to\\n  complete the query. Neo4j, in contrast, returns a result in around two\\n  seconds. At depth five, it transpires almost the entire network is our\\n  friend: for many real-world use cases, we’d likely trim the results,\\n  and the timings.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n<p><strong>Questions are:</strong> </p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n<li>Is this a reasonable test to emulate what one might except to find in a social network? <em>(Meaning do real social networks normally have nodes with approximately 50 friends for example; seems like the \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_rich_get_richer_%28statistics%29\">rich get richer</a>\" model would be more natural for social networks, though might be wrong.)</em></li>\\n<li>Regardless of the naturalness of the emulation, is there any reason to believe the results are off, or unreproducible? </li>\\n</ul>\\n',\n",

For example, you might use the Holm–Bonferroni method.</p>\\n\\n<p>In the case of a large sample rather than a lot of variables, something else is needed.  As Christopher said, magnitude of effect a way to treat this.  Combining these two ideas, you might use a confidence interval around your magnitude of effect, and apply a false discovery rate correction to the p-value of the confidence interval.  The effects for which even the lowest bound of the corrected confidence interval is high are likely to be strong effects, regardless of huge data set size.  I am not aware of any published paper that combines confidence intervals with false discovery rate correction in this way, but it seems like a straightforward and intuitively understandable approach.</p>\\n\\n<p>To make this even better, use a non-parametric way to estimate confidence intervals.  Assuming a distribution is likely to give very optimistic estimates here, and even fitting a distribution to the data is likely to be inaccurate.  Since the information about the shape of the distribution past the edges of the confidence interval comes from a relatively small subsample of the data, this is where it really pays to be careful.  You can use bootstrapping to get a non-parametric confidence interval.</p>\\n',\n",

But here are important things to take into account, and that make it <em>feasible</em> to have such low latency on queries from all these TBs of data in different machines:</p>\\n\\n<ol>\\n<li>distributed computing: by being distributed does not mean that the indexes are simply distributed in different machines, they are actually replicated along different clusters, which allows for lots of users performing different queries with low retrieval time (yes, huge companies can afford for that much of machines);</li>\\n<li>caching: caches tremendously reduce execution time, be it for the crawling step, for the retrieval of pages, or for the ranking and exihibition of results;</li>\\n<li>lots of tweaking: all the above and very efficient algorithms/solutions can only be effective if the implementation is also efficient. There are tons of (hard coded) optimizations, such as locality of reference, compression, caching; all of them usually appliable to different parts of the processing.</li>\\n</ol>\\n\\n<p>Considering that, lets try to address your questions:</p>\\n\\n<blockquote>\\n  <p>but I imagine it infeasible for the results of every single possible query to be indexed</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n<p>Yes, it would be, and actually is infeasible to have results for <em>every single possible query</em>. There is an infinite number of terms in the world (even if you assume that only terms properly spelled will be entered), and there is an exponential number of queries from these <code>n -&gt; inf</code> terms (<code>2^n</code>). So what is done? Caching. But if there are so many queries/results, which ones to cache? Caching policies. The most frequent/popular/relevant-for-the-user queries are the ones cached.</p>\\n\\n<blockquote>\\n  <p>wouldn\\'t the hardware latency in Google\\'s hardware be huge? Even if the data in Google were all stored in TB/s SSDs</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n<p>Nowdays, with such highly developed processors, people tend to think that every possible task that must finish within a second (or less), and that deals with so much data, must be processed by extremely powerful processors with multiple cores and lots of memory. However, the one thing <em>ruling</em> market is money, and the investors are not interested in wasting it. So what is done?</p>\\n\\n<p>The preference is actually for having lots of machines, each using simple/accessible (in terms of cost) processors, which lowers the price of building up the multitude of clusters there are. And yes, it does work. The main bottleneck always boils down to disk, if you consider simple measurements of <a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Uf6al.gif\" rel=\"noreferrer\">performance</a>. But once there are so many machines, one can afford to load things up to main memory, instead of working on hard disks.</p>\\n\\n<p>Memory cards are <em>expensive</em> for us, mere human beings, but they are very cheap for enterprises that buy lots of such cards at once. Since it\\'s not costly, having much memory as needed to load indexes and keep caches at hand is not a problem. And since there are so many machines, there is no need for super fast processors, as you can direct queries to different places, and have clusters of machines responsible for attending <em>specific geographical regions</em>, which allows for more <em>specialized</em> data caching, and even better response times.</p>\\n\\n<blockquote>\\n  <p>Does MapReduce help solve this problem?</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n<p>Although I don\\'t think that using or not MapReduce is restricted information inside Google, I\\'m not conversant about this point. However, Google\\'s implementation of MapReduce (which is surely <em>not</em> Hadoop) must have lots of optimizations, many involving the aspects discussed above. So, the architecture of MapReduce probably helps guiding how the computations are physically distributed, but there are many other points to be considered to justify such speed in querying time.</p>\\n\\n<blockquote>\\n  <p>Okay, so I understand that popular searches can be cached in memory. But what about unpopular searches?</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n<p>The graph below presents a curve of how the <em>kinds</em> of queries occur. You can see that there are three main kinds of searches, each of them holding approximately 1/3 of the volume of queries (area below curve). The plot shows power law, and reinforces the fact that smaller queries are the most popular. The second third of queries are still feasible to process, since they hold few words. But the set of so-called <em>obscure queries</em>, which usually consist of non-experienced users\\' queries, are not a negligible part of the queries.</p>\\n\\n<p><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/CpcNf.jpg\" alt=\"Heavy-tailed distribution\"></p>\\n\\n<p>And there lies space for novel solutions. Since it\\'s not just one or two queries (but one third of them), they must have <em>relevant</em> results. If you type in something <em>much too obscure</em> in a Google search, it shan\\'t take longer to return a list of results, but will most probably show you something it <em>inferred</em> you\\'d like to say. Or it may simply state that there was no document with such terms -- or even cut down your search to 32 words (which just happened to me in a random test here).</p>\\n\\n<p>There are dozens of appliable heuristics, which may be either to ignore some words, or to try to break the query into smaller ones, and gather the most <em>popular</em> results. And all these solutions can be tailored and tweaked to respect <em>feasible waiting times</em> of, say, less then a second? :D</p>\\n',\n",

Google has moved off of MapReduce for most jobs now, and even the Hadoop ecosystem is doing the same.</p>\\n\\n<p>The answer to low latency is generally to keep precomputed indices in memory. Anything that touches disk is hard to make fast and scale. This is how newer-generation Hadoop-based SQL engines like <a href=\"http://www.cloudera.com/content/cloudera/en/products-and-services/cdh/impala.html\">Impala</a> get so much speed compared to MapReduce-based infrastructure like <a href=\"http://hive.apache.org/\">Hive</a>, for example.</p>\\n\\n<p>Search infrastructure can\\'t cache the results of every single query. But it sure can cache intermediate results, or, more complete results for top queries. With a little caching you can serve results for a significant minority of all queries.</p>\\n\\n<p>Search is also split across servers. So one machine can delegate to 100 to each get a part of the result and then combine them.</p>\\n\\n<p>You can also get away with some degree of approximation. Google does not literally form a thousand pages of search results; it just has to get the first page about right.</p>\\n\\n<p>Keep in mind that Google has <em>millions</em> of computers around the globe. Your queries are going to a data center geographically near to you and that is only serving your geography. This cuts out most of the latency, which is network and not processing time in the data center.</p>\\n',\n",

Orient is a Graph-Document database server written entirely in Java. </p>\\n\\n<p>In graph databases, relationships are considered first class citizens and therefore traversing those relationships can be done pretty quickly. Orient is also a document database which would allow you the kind of schema-free architecture it sounds like you would need. The real reason I suggest Orient, however, is because of its extensiblity. It supports streaming via sockets, and the entire database can be embedded into another application. Finally, it can be scaled efficiently and/or can work entirely through memory. So, with some Java expertise, you can actually run your preset queries against the database in memory.</p>\\n\\n<p>We are doing something similar. In creating an app/site for social science research collaboration, we found ourselves with immensely complex data models. We ended up writing several of the queries using the Gremlin Traversal Language (a subset of Groovy, which is, of course, Java at its heart), and then exposing those queries through the binary connection server of the OrientDB. So, the client opens a TCP socket, sends a short binary message, and the query is executing in Java directly against the in-memory database.</p>\\n\\n<p>OrientDB also supports writing function queries in Javascript, and you can use Node.js to interact directly with an Orient instance.</p>\\n\\n<p>For something of this size, I would want to use Orient in conjunction with Hadoop or something like that. You can also use Orient in conjunction with esper.</p>\\n\\n<p>Consider:\\nAn introduction to orient: <a href=\"http://www.sitepoint.com/a-look-at-orientdb-the-graph-document-nosql/\">http://www.sitepoint.com/a-look-at-orientdb-the-graph-document-nosql/</a></p>\\n\\n<p>Complex, real-time queries: <a href=\"http://www.gft-blog.com/business-trends/leveraging-real-time-scoring-through-bigdata-to-detect-insurance-fraud/\">http://www.gft-blog.com/business-trends/leveraging-real-time-scoring-through-bigdata-to-detect-insurance-fraud/</a></p>\\n\\n<p>A discussion about streaming options with java and orient: <a href=\"https://github.com/orientechnologies/orientdb/issues/1227\">https://github.com/orientechnologies/orientdb/issues/1227</a></p>\\n',\n",

The age for a person in the user item matrix might be well determined by something like the mean or median age of some nearest neighbors in the item space.</p>\\n\\n<p>So you have each user expressed as a vector in item space, find the k nearest neighbors and assign the vector in question some summary stat of the nearest neighbor ages.  You can choose k on a distance cutoff or more realistically by iteratively assigning ages to a train hold out and choosing the k that minimizes the error in that assignment.</p>\\n\\n<p>If the dimensionality is a problem you can easily perform reduction in this setup by single value decomposition choosing the m vectors that capture the most variance across the group.</p>\\n\\n<p>In all cases since each feature is binary it seems that cosine similarity would be your go to distance metric.</p>\\n\\n<p>I need to think a bit more about other approaches (regression, rf, etc...) given the narrow focus of your feature space (all variants of the same action, liking) I think the user/item approach might be the best.</p>\\n\\n<p>One note of caution, if the ages you have for train are self reported you might need to correct some of them.  People on facebook tend to report ages in the decade they were born.  Plot a histogram of the birth dates (derived from ages) and see if you have spikes at decades like 70s, 80s, 90s.</p>\\n',\n",
